## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Let them know where to go, how often they can expect an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if it is accepted or declined, etc.

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to [oso@intersectmbo.org]. You will receive a response within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible, depending on complexity, but historically, within a few days.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.
Instead, please email opensource-security[@]github.com 
Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:
The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
